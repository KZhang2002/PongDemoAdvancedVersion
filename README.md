# PongDemoAdvancedVersion
The advanced version of my pong demo. Features a scoring system, ball spawning, and other additional features. To use these files, just extract the zip into a folder and open that folder using Unity. Then, open a scene in the scene folder.

Some of the planned features here are not fully implemented. There may be bugs.

A guide for the workshop version of this demo can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17wH_65lJJD9IfhDBnlSRuh3cHBO4T6YeGjKyuIVOeGc/edit?usp=sharing
